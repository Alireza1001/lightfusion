-Wordpress warning in wp-include/class.wp-scripts.php

There is a new bug(warning) in wordpress at file wp-include/class.wp-scripts.php at line 492
**I fixed it**
change the code to this:
 *if(strlen($value)>0) $l10n[ $key ] = html_entity_decode((string) $value,ENT_QUOTES,'UTF-8');*
The warning is because of the php update which made the php more sensitive
and the problem was because of the array managment.
